## API Integration

The frontend connects to the TouNetCore Go backend API running on `localhost:44544`. Key features include:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based login and registration
- **User Management**: Profile updates and user administration
- **Application Management**: CRUD operations for applications
- **NKey System**: Generate and validate temporary access keys
- **Invite Codes**: Registration code management

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Features Overview

### User Dashboard
- View profile information and account status
- Update phone number and PushDeer token
- Generate NKeys for application access
- View available applications

### Admin Dashboard
- System overview with key metrics
- User management (create, view, delete users)
- Application management (create, update, delete apps)
- Invite code generation and tracking
- Comprehensive user and system administration

### Authentication Flow
1. Users register with an invite code
2. Admin can create users directly
3. JWT tokens for session management
4. Role-based access control (Admin vs User)

### NKey System
- Generate temporary 15-minute access keys
- Support for multiple applications per key
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Visual feedback and expiration warnings

## Styling and UI

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Modern UI components** with proper accessibility
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **Clean, professional design** with consistent spacing and colors

## Environment Configuration

The API base URL is configured in `src/lib/api.ts`:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:44544/api/v1';
```

Update this URL if your backend API runs on a different port or domain.
